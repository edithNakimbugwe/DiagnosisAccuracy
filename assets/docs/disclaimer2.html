We do not recommend or endorse any specific tests, physicians, products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on the App. 
While information on this App has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, neither we nor our content providers warrant the accuracy of the information contained on this App. We do not give medical advice, nor do we provide medical or diagnostic services. Medical information changes rapidly, and neither we nor our content providers guarantee that the content covers all possible uses, directions, precautions, drug interactions, or adverse effects that may be associated with any therapeutic treatments.
